        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is a Smart Contract?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          A smart contract is essentially a program that runs on the blockchain. It is not a contract in the traditional sense, like a legal document, but rather a piece of code that automatically executes when certain conditions are met.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Imagine you and a friend make a bet on a cricket match. Instead of trusting each other to pay up, you both send 100 rupees to a smart contract. The code specifies: If Team A wins, send the total amount to Person X; if Team B wins, send it to Person Y. Once the match ends and the condition is verified, the contract executes automatically. No one can change it, there is no cheating, and no middleman is involved. That is the magic—trustless automation.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Why Ethereum?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While there are many blockchain platforms such as Solana, Polygon, and BNB Chain, Ethereum is the original and most widely adopted platform for smart contracts. It is battle-tested, has a massive developer community, and most learning resources are Ethereum-based, making it easier to start out.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Smart contracts on Ethereum are written in a programming language called Solidity, which looks a lot like JavaScript but comes with its own unique features.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">What Can You Build with Smart Contracts?</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Lending platforms, staking, and exchanges</li>
          <li>NFT Marketplaces: Minting, buying and selling, and royalties</li>
          <li>Voting Systems: Fully transparent and secure elections</li>
          <li>DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations): Community-driven platforms with no central authority</li>
          <li>Remittance Platforms: You have already explored this concept</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you are dreaming about building the next big decentralized app, your journey starts with smart contracts.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Tips Before You Go Full dApp Mode</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li>Gas fees exist. Every interaction with a smart contract costs gas (ETH), so use testnets while learning.</li>
          <li>Security is everything. A single bug in your contract could cost real money. Learn about reentrancy, overflows, and access control.</li>
          <li>Frontend plus smart contracts equals a dApp. Use libraries like Web3.js or Ethers.js to connect your React or JavaScript frontend to your contract.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Smart contracts are the future of how we automate trust. They eliminate the need for middlemen, remove unnecessary bureaucracy, and open up a world of decentralized innovation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Whether you want to build your own DeFi app, mint NFTs, or simply experiment with blockchain technology, learning smart contracts is your gateway.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The best part is that you do not need to be a genius to get started—just be curious, consistent, and a little obsessed with solving real-world problems using code.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          So go ahead, deploy your first contract, break it, fix it, and understand it. Web3 is not just coming, it is already here, and it is being built by developers like you.
