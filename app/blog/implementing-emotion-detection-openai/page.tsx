        <p className="mb-4"><strong>VibeSync</strong> started with a simple idea: build a mental health chatbot that listens, responds gently, and gives people a space to feel heard. We didn’t want to reinvent the wheel—we just wanted to wrap powerful AI in a friendly, calming UI. So that’s exactly what we did.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">The hackathon was hosted right here in Nagpur—just a few hours long, more like a sprint than a marathon. No fancy tech stack. No backend juggling. We used the <strong>Together AI API</strong> for the chatbot and focused purely on front-end branding. In truth, it was a white-label build—we designed the face and flow, but the heart of it was powered by an external AI model. We knew it wasn’t groundbreaking tech-wise, but the user experience was what we cared about.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-8">Quick Execution, Clear Vision</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">We had around 7–8 hours in total. We divided the work fast, built a clean interface, connected the chatbot flow to the API, and wrapped it up with a soothing visual theme. It looked good, worked smoothly, and had a clear purpose—to help people feel mentally lighter, one message at a time.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-8">The Judge Moment I’ll Never Forget</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">Now here’s the part I didn’t expect. During the evaluation round, one of the judges looked at our project, chuckled a bit… then laughed. Like, really laughed. Not just a polite smile—full-on teeth-out amusement. And it wasn’t even in front of the whole group—it was in private, just the two of us in the room. That moment is burned into my memory. I didn’t show it then, but it genuinely hurt.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">We didn’t expect a standing ovation or anything. But to be laughed at for something we had worked hard on—even if it was a simpler build—felt disrespectful. There’s a difference between honest feedback and just... mockery. And that line got crossed that day.</p>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-8">What VibeSync Taught Me</h3>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Not Every Project Has to Be Complex:</strong> Simplicity has its own value. We aimed for usability and clean design—and we nailed that.</li>
          <li><strong>Criticism Isn’t Always Constructive:</strong> Some people will just laugh. That doesn’t make your work worthless. It just means you need to believe in it more than they doubt it.</li>
          <li><strong>Confidence Can’t Be External:</strong> If you build only for applause, moments like these will crush you. Build because you believe the idea matters—even if it’s version 0.1.</li>
          <li><strong>Hackathons Are Still Wins, Even Without Prizes:</strong> We showed up, we delivered, and we learned. That’s a win.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 mt-8">The Aftermath</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">We didn’t place. We didn’t get a certificate or a shoutout. But we walked out with a working product, a lesson in resilience, and a story we’ll never forget. And honestly? I’d still build VibeSync again. Because not every project is about impressing judges—sometimes it’s just about creating something that feels right.</p>

        <p className="mb-4">And next time someone laughs? I’ll laugh back—then out-code them.</p>
